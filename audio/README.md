# Audio Files

This directory should contain the following audio files for the game:

- `background.mp3` - Background music that plays during gameplay
- `hit.mp3` - Sound effect for when the player jumps, bounces or hits obstacles
- `coin.mp3` - Success sound for when the player collects coins

Note: You'll need to add these files to this directory for the audio to work properly in the game.
